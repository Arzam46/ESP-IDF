# ESP32 OLED Display Example (SSD1306)

This project demonstrates how to interface a 0.96-inch SSD1306-based I2C OLED display with an ESP32 using the **ESP-IDF framework**. It displays a simple "Hello!" message on the screen.

---

## 🧰 Features

- Supports SSD1306 I2C OLED display (128x64)
- Uses **nopnop2002’s SSD1306** external component (manually added)
- Displays "Hello!" message with correct horizontal alignment
- Compatible with ESP-IDF v4.4.x

## 📦 External Component Used

This project uses the **SSD1306 OLED display driver by [nopnop2002](https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-ssd1306)**, which was manually extracted and added into the `components/ssd1306` folder.

> ℹ️ Only the necessary `ssd1306` code was retained. Demo folders like `cardemo`, `imagedemo`, etc., were removed to keep the project minimal and clean.

## 🔌 Wiring (ESP32 with 0.96" I2C OLED)

| OLED Pin | ESP32 Pin |
|----------|-----------|
| VCC      | 3.3V      |
| GND      | GND       |
| SDA      | GPIO 21   |
| SCL      | GPIO 22   |

You can change these GPIOs in the `main.c` source.

## 🚀 Build and Flash

Make sure your ESP-IDF environment is set up correctly. Then run:

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py build
idf.py -p <PORT> flash monitor
